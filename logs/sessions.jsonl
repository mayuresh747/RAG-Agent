{"timestamp": "2026-02-11T02:17:20.567062+00:00", "question": "What are the tenant rights for eviction in Washington?", "answer": "Washington tenant protections around eviction are mostly in the Residential Landlord‑Tenant Act (RLTA), chapter 59.18 RCW. Below are the core rights that appear in the materials you provided.\n\n---\n\n### 1. “Just cause” is required for most evictions\n\nState law generally prohibits a landlord from evicting a residential tenant, refusing to continue a tenancy, or ending a periodic tenancy unless the landlord has one of the specific legal “causes” listed in RCW 59.18.650(2) [Source 9]:\n\n> “A landlord may not evict a tenant, refuse to continue a tenancy, or end a periodic tenancy **except for the causes enumerated in subsection (2)** of this section and as otherwise provided in this subsection.” [Source 9]\n\nThis means:\n- A landlord usually cannot evict you or end a month‑to‑month tenancy “for no reason.”\n- They must rely on one of the statutory reasons (nonpayment of rent, substantial breach of the rental agreement, owner move‑in, etc., as detailed in RCW 59.18.650(2), which is referenced but not fully reproduced in the excerpts).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Required notices and service\n\nWhen a landlord wants to end a tenancy or evict, they must give written notice and serve it in a legally proper way.\n\nRCW 59.18.650(6) requires that notices under that section:\n\n> “All written notices required under subsection (2) of this section must:  \n> (a) **Be served in a manner consistent with RCW 59.12.040**; and …” [Source 4]\n\nKey points:\n- Notices must be written.\n- They must be served using the methods allowed in RCW 59.12.040 (for example, personal delivery, or posting and mailing, depending on circumstances).\n- If the landlord does not serve notice correctly, that can be a defense in an eviction case.\n\nSeparately, for older general tenancy rules, RCW 59.04.020 provides that a month‑to‑month tenancy is terminated by:\n\n> “written notice of thirty days or more, preceding the end of any of said months or periods, given by either party to the other.” [Source 10]\n\nHowever, for most residential tenancies, the more specific “just cause” and notice rules in RCW 59.18.650 now control when and how a landlord can actually end the tenancy and proceed to eviction.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Court process and writ of restitution\n\nYou cannot be physically removed from your home without a court process and a writ of restitution executed by the sheriff.\n\nRCW 59.18.390 describes what happens after a landlord wins an unlawful detainer (eviction) case:\n\n> “The sheriff shall, upon receiving the **writ of restitution**, forthwith serve a copy thereof upon the tenant … and **shall not execute the same for three days thereafter**.” [Source 6]\n\nThis means:\n- The landlord must file an unlawful detainer lawsuit and obtain a court judgment.\n- Only after judgment can the court issue a writ of restitution.\n- The sheriff must serve the writ and wait at least three days before physically removing you.\n- A landlord cannot lawfully lock you out, remove your belongings, or shut off utilities on their own.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Protection against “self‑help” or wrongful eviction\n\nRCW 59.18.650(4) creates a specific remedy if a landlord removes a tenant in violation of the statute:\n\n> “A landlord who removes a tenant or causes a tenant to be removed from a dwelling in any way in violation of this section is **liable to the tenant for wrongful eviction**, and the tenant prevailing in such an action is entitled to the greater of their economic and noneconomic damages or **three times the monthly rent** of the dwelling at issue, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs.” [Source 4]\n\nSo if a landlord:\n- Locks you out without a court order,\n- Forces you out without following the required causes and notices,\nyou may sue for wrongful eviction and recover at least the statutory damages plus attorney’s fees if you win.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Special rules for nonpayment of rent and notices\n\nThe excerpts you provided do not include the full nonpayment‑of‑rent section of RCW 59.18, but they do show that:\n- There are specific notice forms and information that must be given to tenants in nonpayment cases, including information about rental assistance and legal help [Source 1], [Source 7].\n- Tenants must receive information about dispute resolution centers and legal aid:\n\n> “Free or low-cost mediation services to assist in nonpayment of rent disputes before any judicial proceedings occur are also available at dispute resolution centers throughout the state. You can find your nearest dispute resolution center at https://www.resolutionwa.org.” [Source 7]\n\nThis supports:\n- A right to receive certain standardized notices and information when facing eviction for nonpayment.\n- Access to mediation services before or during the eviction process.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Right to seek legal representation in eviction cases\n\nRCW 59.18 includes a required notice that informs tenants of a right to legal representation in eviction proceedings if they are low‑income:\n\n> “State law provides you the **right to legal representation** and the court may be able to appoint a lawyer to represent you without cost to you if you are a qualifying low-income renter. If you believe you are a qualifying low-income renter and would like an attorney appointed to represent you, please contact the Eviction Defense Screening Line at 855-657-8387 or apply online at https://nwjustice.org/apply-online.” [Source 1]\n\nThis means:\n- Low‑income tenants in eviction cases may be entitled to a court‑appointed lawyer at no cost.\n- The landlord’s notice must include this information and contact details.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Limits on ending fixed‑term tenancies\n\nRCW 59.18.650(5) restricts ending a fixed‑term tenancy early:\n\n> “Nothing in subsection (2)(d), (e), or (f) of this section permits a landlord to end a tenancy for a specified period before the completion of the term unless the landlord and the tenant mutually consent, in writing, to ending the tenancy early and the tenant is afforded at least 60 days to vacate.” [Source 4]\n\nSo:\n- If you have a lease for a specific term (e.g., 12 months), the landlord generally cannot use those particular causes to end it before the term ends, unless:\n  - You and the landlord both agree in writing, and\n  - You get at least 60 days to move.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Additional resources and help\n\nThe statute requires that tenants be given information about legal and rental assistance resources, including:\n\n- Attorney General’s landlord‑tenant website and rental assistance programs [Source 1].\n- Northwest Justice Project and 2‑1‑1 [Source 1], [Source 7].\n- WashingtonLawHelp.org [Source 5], [Source 7].\n\nThese are not “rights” in the sense of defenses, but they are mandated information intended to help tenants exercise their rights.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of key eviction‑related rights in Washington (from the provided materials)\n\n1. **Just cause required** for most evictions and terminations of tenancy (RCW 59.18.650) [Source 9].  \n2. **Written notice and proper service** are mandatory; notices must follow RCW 59.12.040 procedures [Source 4].  \n3. **Court process and writ of restitution** are required before physical removal; only the sheriff can enforce the writ, with at least a 3‑day waiting period after service [Source 6].  \n4. **Protection from self‑help/wrongful eviction**, with potential damages of at least three times monthly rent plus attorney’s fees [Source 4].  \n5. **Information and access to mediation and rental assistance** in nonpayment cases [Source 1], [Source 7].  \n6. **Right to appointed counsel for qualifying low‑income tenants** in eviction proceedings, with required notice of how to request a lawyer [Source 1].  \n7. **Limits on early termination of fixed‑term leases**, including a 60‑day minimum move‑out period if both parties agree to end early under certain causes [Source 4].\n\nIf you tell me whether you’re dealing with nonpayment, lease violations, or a no‑cause notice, I can walk through how these protections apply to your specific situation using the statutes.", "input_tokens": 2792, "output_tokens": 1793, "total_tokens": 4585, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 23456}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-11T02:19:10.208022+00:00", "question": "What are the requirements for building permits in Washington state? Please provide the information in a table if possible, comparing residential and commercial requirements.", "answer": "Below is what appears in the provided Washington‑state materials about building permit requirements, with a focus on what’s clearly stated and comparable for residential vs. commercial. The excerpts you gave are mostly about **state‑mandated fees and application content**, not the full technical code requirements.\n\nI’ll separate:\n\n- General application content (from RCW 19.27.095)  \n- State building‑code‑council (SBCC) surcharge fees (RCW 19.27.085 as quoted in the code books)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic building permit application content (all projects over $5,000)\n\nRCW 19.27.095 applies to “a valid and fully complete building permit application” and sets a **minimum content** for projects costing more than $5,000. It does not distinguish residential vs. commercial in the text we have:\n\n> “The requirements for a fully completed application shall be defined by local ordinance but for any construction project costing more than five thousand dollars the application shall include, at a minimum:  \n> (a) The legal description, or the tax parcel number … and the street address if available, and …” [Source 6]\n\nThe rest of the subsection is not in the excerpt, but the key point is:\n\n- Local governments can add more requirements by ordinance.\n- For projects over $5,000, the application must at least include:\n  - Legal description or tax parcel number, and\n  - Street address (if available). [Source 6]\n\nThis minimum applies to **both residential and commercial** building permits.\n\n---\n\n## 2. State‑mandated SBCC surcharge fees (residential vs. commercial)\n\nMultiple Washington‑adopted code books (IBC, IRC, IFC, etc.) repeat the same statutory fee language from RCW 19.27.085. These are **state surcharges** that every city and county must collect on building permits and remit to the State Building Code Council.\n\nFrom the Washington‑amended International Building Code, International Residential Code, International Fire Code, etc.:\n\n> “Section 19.27.085 of the State Building Code Act requires that a fee of **$6.50 be imposed on each residential permit and $25.00 on each commercial building permit** issued by each city and county. In addition, a fee of **$2.00 per unit shall be imposed for each dwelling unit after the first unit**, on each building containing more than one residential unit. For the purpose of this fee, **WAC 365‑110‑035 defines building permits as any permit to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or demolish any building or structure regulated by the Building Code.** Exempt from the fee are plumbing, electrical, mechanical permits, permits issued to install a mobile/manufactured home, commercial coach, or factory‑built structure, or permits issued pursuant to the International Fire Code.”  \n> [Source 1], [Source 3], [Source 4], [Source 5]\n\nSeattle’s Director’s Rule 2‑2021 confirms that SDCI must collect these same state fees:\n\n> “each residential unit after the first unit (RCW 19.27.085). Each Washington county and city is required to remit moneys collected for this purpose to the state treasurer on a quarterly basis. SDCI has always added this fee and any related surcharges to building permits issued by the City of Seattle.” [Source 8]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Comparison table: residential vs. commercial (from the provided materials)\n\nThe table below is limited to what is clearly stated in the excerpts you provided. Local jurisdictions can and do add many more requirements (plans, engineering, energy code compliance, etc.), but those are not spelled out in the retrieved text.\n\n### A. Application content (RCW 19.27.095 – applies to both)\n\n| Topic | Residential Building Permit | Commercial Building Permit | Source |\n|-------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------|\n| When is a “fully complete” application required? | For any construction project costing more than $5,000, the application must meet minimum state content; local ordinance can add more. | Same rule: any construction project over $5,000 must meet minimum state content; local ordinance can add more. | RCW 19.27.095(2) [Source 6] |\n| Minimum required content (over $5,000) | Must include at least: (a) legal description or tax parcel number; and street address if available. (Other items likely exist in the full statute but are not in the excerpt.) | Same: legal description or tax parcel number; and street address if available. | RCW 19.27.095(2)(a) [Source 6] |\n| Who defines “fully complete” beyond the minimum? | Local ordinance (city/county) defines additional requirements. | Same. | RCW 19.27.095(2) [Source 6] |\n\nFrom the materials you provided, there is **no explicit difference** in the statutory minimum application content between residential and commercial; the distinction appears mainly in the **state surcharge fees**.\n\n### B. State Building Code Council (SBCC) surcharge fees (RCW 19.27.085 as quoted)\n\n| Topic | Residential Building Permit | Commercial Building Permit | Source |\n|-------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------|\n| Base SBCC fee per permit | “a fee of **$6.50** be imposed on each residential permit” | “a fee of **$25.00** on each commercial building permit” | IBC/IRC/IFC WA amendments quoting RCW 19.27.085 [Source 1], [Source 3], [Source 4], [Source 5] |\n| Additional per‑unit fee | “a fee of **$2.00 per unit** shall be imposed for each dwelling unit after the first unit, on each building containing more than one residential unit” | No additional per‑unit fee mentioned for commercial permits in the excerpt. | Same as above [Source 1], [Source 3], [Source 4], [Source 5] |\n| Definition of “building permit” for this fee | “WAC 365‑110‑035 defines building permits as any permit to **construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or demolish** any building or structure regulated by the Building Code.” | Same definition applies; it is a general definition of “building permits” for fee purposes. | Same as above [Source 1], [Source 3], [Source 4], [Source 5] |\n| Exempt permits (no SBCC fee) | Exempt from this state fee: “plumbing, electrical, mechanical permits, permits issued to install a mobile/manufactured home, commercial coach, or factory‑built structure, or permits issued pursuant to the International Fire Code.” | Same exemptions apply. | Same as above [Source 1], [Source 3], [Source 4], [Source 5] |\n| Who collects and remits | “Each city and county shall remit moneys collected to the state treasury quarterly.” | Same. | IFC WA amendments [Source 5]; Seattle DR 2‑2021 [Source 8] |\n\n---\n\n## 4. What is *not* in the provided excerpts\n\nThe documents you shared do **not** include:\n\n- The full text of RCW 19.27.085 (only quoted portions in the code books).  \n- Detailed technical submittal requirements (e.g., number of plan sets, structural calculations, energy code forms) for residential vs. commercial.  \n- Local building department checklists (which often differ significantly between residential and commercial).\n\nThose details are typically found in:\n- The full RCW 19.27 and related WAC chapters (e.g., WAC 51‑50, 51‑51, 51‑11C/11R), and  \n- Local ordinances and administrative rules (e.g., a city’s building code chapter and permit submittal standards).\n\nFrom the materials you provided, the **clearest, text‑supported differences** between residential and commercial building permits at the state level are:\n\n1. Different **SBCC surcharge amounts** ($6.50 vs. $25.00).  \n2. An **additional $2.00 per dwelling unit after the first** for multi‑unit residential buildings.  \n3. Otherwise, the **minimum application content rule** in RCW 19.27.095 applies to both.\n\nIf you tell me which jurisdiction (e.g., Seattle, Spokane, unincorporated county) you’re in, I can look for that city/county’s specific residential vs. commercial submittal requirements and add another comparison table based on their local ordinances or director’s rules.", "input_tokens": 4945, "output_tokens": 1851, "total_tokens": 6796, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 25250}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-11T02:31:00.957603+00:00", "question": "What are the fire sprinkler requirements for high-rise buildings under IBC?", "answer": "Under the 2021/2024 International Building Code (as amended for Washington), high‑rise buildings must be fully sprinklered with an NFPA 13 system, and several related provisions in the International Fire Code (IFC) reinforce this.\n\nFrom the retrieved materials:\n\n1. **General sprinkler requirement for new buildings (IFC 903.2)**  \n   The IFC (adopted alongside the IBC) requires automatic sprinklers in new buildings where specified in Sections 903.2.1–903.2.12:  \n   - “Approved automatic sprinkler systems in new buildings and structures shall be provided in the locations described in Sections 903.2.1 through 903.2.12.” [Source 10]  \n\n   High‑rise buildings (as defined in the IBC: occupied floor >75 ft above lowest fire department access) fall into occupancies that trigger these sections, and high‑rise provisions in the IBC require full sprinkler protection using NFPA 13.\n\n2. **System type for high‑rise (NFPA 13 vs. 13R)**  \n   The IBC/IFC distinguish between NFPA 13 and NFPA 13R systems. NFPA 13R is only allowed in low‑rise residential (Group R) buildings up to 4 stories and 60 ft in height:  \n   - “Automatic sprinkler systems in Group R occupancies up to and including four stories in height in buildings not exceeding 60 feet (18,288 mm) in height above grade plane shall be permitted to be installed throughout in accordance with NFPA 13R.” [Source 1, IFC 903.3.1.2]  \n\n   Because high‑rise buildings exceed 75 ft in height, they cannot use NFPA 13R; they must use a full NFPA 13 system (IBC 903.3.1.1, not fully quoted in the retrieved pages but cross‑referenced in multiple sections, e.g. [Source 8]).\n\n3. **Group R high‑rise occupancies**  \n   The IBC explicitly requires new Group R occupancies to be sprinklered:  \n   - “New Group R occupancies are required to be protected by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.2.8.” [Source 3, footnote h]  \n\n   For high‑rise residential buildings, this requirement combines with the high‑rise provisions to mandate a full NFPA 13 system throughout.\n\n4. **Podium / vertical separation conditions (relevant to tall mixed‑use/high‑rise)**  \n   For buildings using podium (horizontal separation) designs, the IBC requires the lower portion to be fully sprinklered with an NFPA 13 system:  \n   - “The building below the horizontal assembly shall be protected throughout by an approved automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1…” [Source 8, IBC 510.2 condition 6]  \n\n   High‑rise towers over podiums therefore must have:\n   - NFPA 13 sprinklers throughout the podium portion, and  \n   - NFPA 13 sprinklers throughout the tower (because it is a high‑rise).\n\n5. **Wildland‑urban interface high‑rise context (if applicable)**  \n   Where a high‑rise (or any building) is in a wildland‑urban interface area and required to meet Class 1 ignition‑resistant construction, sprinklers can also be mandated:  \n   - “An approved automatic sprinkler system shall be installed in all occupancies in new buildings required to meet the requirements for Class 1 ignition-resistant construction in Chapter 5 when required by the authority having jurisdiction.” [Source 6, IWUIC 602.1]  \n\n   This is an additional trigger, not a substitute for the high‑rise requirements.\n\n6. **Basements and special areas in high‑rise buildings**  \n   Specific IFC provisions require sprinklers in certain conditions that will often apply in high‑rise basements and service areas:  \n   - Basements with remote areas: “the basement shall be equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system” where portions are more than 75 ft from required openings or new partitions increase travel distance beyond 75 ft. [Source 4, IFC 903.2.11.1.3]  \n   - Commercial cooking exhaust systems using sprinklers for hood protection must have sprinklers in the hood/duct system. [Source 4, IFC 903.2.11.5]\n\n7. **Construction‑phase water supply / standpipes for tall buildings**  \n   While not the permanent sprinkler system, the IFC also imposes water supply and standpipe requirements during construction of tall mass‑timber buildings, which are analogous to high‑rise fire‑protection expectations:  \n   - “Standpipes shall be provided in accordance with Section 3307.” and “A water supply for fire department operations, as approved by the fire code official and the fire chief.” [Source 9, IFC 3312.1(1)–(2)]  \n\n   High‑rise construction will similarly require early standpipe and water supply per IFC Chapter 33 (not fully quoted here).\n\nPutting this together, under the IBC/IFC framework as shown in the retrieved text:\n\n- High‑rise buildings must be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system designed and installed in accordance with NFPA 13 (not NFPA 13R).  \n- New Group R high‑rise occupancies must be sprinklered per IBC 903.2.8 [Source 3].  \n- Podium portions of high‑rise/podium buildings must be fully sprinklered with an NFPA 13 system [Source 8].  \n- Additional area‑specific triggers (basements, commercial kitchens, wildland‑urban interface conditions) can add or reinforce sprinkler requirements [Sources 4, 5, 6].  \n\nIf you want, I can next:  \n- Pull the exact IBC high‑rise definition and the core high‑rise sprinkler section text, or  \n- Summarize the typical high‑rise sprinkler design features (zoning, redundancy, fire pumps, etc.) beyond what’s in the code excerpts.", "input_tokens": 2858, "output_tokens": 1287, "total_tokens": 4145, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 13287}

However, the materials I have access to right now only include the Washington‑adopted International Fire Code and related state building code documents, not the specific Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), Seattle Fire Code amendments, or King County fire code ordinances.\n\nBecause of the “global RAG‑only” rule, I cannot infer or guess at Seattle‑vs‑King County differences without actually seeing both sets of local rules. In the retrieved context, I only have:\n\n- State‑level adoption and enforcement framework for the International Fire Code (IFC) via chapter 51‑54A WAC and RCW 19.27, including:\n  - The IFC is adopted statewide and “shall become effective in all counties and cities of this state” [Source 4].\n  - Local jurisdictions are required to enforce the State Building Code [Source 5].\n  - Local amendments are allowed, subject to State Building Code Council procedures [Source 5].\n  - In case of conflict, exceptions and amendments in RCW 19.27 control [Source 9].\n\nKey excerpts:\n\n- Statewide adoption and local enforcement:\n\n  - “The International Fire Code adopted by chapter 51‑54A WAC shall become effective in all counties and cities of this state on March 15, 2024.” [Source 4]\n\n  - “Enforcement: The State Building Code Act requires that each local jurisdiction enforce the State Building Code within its jurisdiction.” [Source 5]\n\n- Local amendments framework:\n\n  - “The State Building Code Council has adopted review procedures and approval criteria for local amendments. These procedures and criteria are found in Chapter 51‑04 WAC. The Council has exempted from its review any amendments to the administrative provisions of the various codes.” [Source 5]\n\n- State‑level conflict rule:\n\n  - “The exceptions and amendments to the International Fire Code contained in the provisions of chapter 19.27 RCW shall apply in case of conflict with any of the provisions of these rules.” [Source 9]\n\nFrom these, I can say:\n\n- Both Seattle and King County must enforce the State‑adopted International Fire Code.\n- Both may adopt local amendments, especially to administrative provisions, but those amendments must fit within the state framework and are subject to State Building Code Council rules [Source 5].\n- The state IFC and RCW 19.27 preempt conflicting provisions in the WAC‑adopted IFC text itself [Source 9], but I do not have the specific Seattle or King County texts to compare.\n\nBecause I lack the Seattle and King County fire code documents in the retrieved context, I cannot:\n\n- Identify specific “fire code verification” procedures in Seattle vs. King County.\n- Determine whether there are conflicts, stricter/looser verification standards, or different inspection/approval processes between them.\n\nAccordingly, I cannot build a valid friction/conflict matrix for this topic.\n\nFriction Matrix Table\n\nNo entries can be created, because I do not have both:\n- A specific State citation AND\n- A specific, retrieved Seattle or King County local citation\nthat clearly differ on “fire code verification.”\n\nNotes\n\n- Investigated topic: “Variances in fire code verification between Seattle and King County.”\n  - State side: Located general IFC adoption and enforcement framework [Sources 4, 5, 9].\n  - Local side: No Seattle Municipal Code / Seattle Fire Code or King County fire code text was available in the provided materials.\n  - Result: Topic is “one‑sided / no conflict determined” under the instructions, so it cannot appear in the conflict table.\n\nIf you can provide:\n- The specific Seattle Fire Code or SMC sections you’re concerned about, and\n- The specific King County fire code or fire authority rules (or at least citations or text excerpts),\n\nI can then run a proper side‑by‑side comparison and classify any conflicts or differences in verification requirements.", "input_tokens": 2310, "output_tokens": 855, "total_tokens": 3165, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 10878}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-11T02:36:21.866931+00:00", "question": "Variances in fire code verification between Seattle and King County", "answer": "[Provide the Friction Matrix Table here, followed by a short Notes section]\n\nYou asked generally about “variances in fire code verification between Seattle and King County,” but you did **not** explicitly ask for conflicts, inconsistencies, or preemption. Under my instructions, I should explain how the systems work rather than build a conflict matrix.\n\nFrom the retrieved materials, we can see how Washington’s fire code framework is set up, but we do **not** have Seattle- or King‑County‑specific fire code texts in the excerpts, so I can only describe the state-level structure and what it implies.\n\nKey state framework points\n\n1. State adoption of the International Fire Code (IFC)\n\n- Washington adopts the IFC through chapter 51‑54A WAC, which is part of the State Building Code:\n\n  - “International Fire Code  \n    Chapter 51‑54A WAC  \n    Effective March 15, 2024” [Source 3].\n\n  - “The International Fire Code adopted by chapter 51‑54A WAC shall become effective in all counties and cities of this state on March 15, 2024.” [Source 4]\n\n  This means both Seattle and King County must enforce the IFC as amended by the state.\n\n2. Local duty to enforce the State Building Code\n\n- The State Building Code Act requires local jurisdictions to enforce the state‑adopted codes:\n\n  - “Enforcement: The State Building Code Act requires that each local jurisdiction enforce the State Building Code within its jurisdiction. Any jurisdiction can contract with another jurisdiction or an inspection agency to provide the mandated enforcement activities.” [Source 5]\n\n  “Local jurisdiction” here includes cities (like Seattle) and counties (like King County). Each must have a system for plan review, permitting, and inspection/verification of fire‑code compliance.\n\n3. Local amendments and procedures\n\n- The State Building Code Council (SBCC) controls how local amendments to the state codes are reviewed:\n\n  - “The State Building Code Council has adopted review procedures and approval criteria for local amendments. These procedures and criteria are found in Chapter 51‑04 WAC. The Council has exempted from its review any amendments to the administrative provisions of the various codes.” [Source 5]\n\n  This is important for “verification” differences:\n  - **Technical** fire‑safety requirements (e.g., fire‑resistance ratings, sprinkler thresholds) are generally subject to SBCC review if a city or county wants to change them.\n  - **Administrative** provisions (e.g., how inspections are scheduled, what documentation is required, local permit processes, local fee structures, internal verification workflows) can be amended locally without SBCC review.\n\n4. Priority of state fire‑code amendments\n\n- Where there is a conflict between the IFC and state law, the state’s amendments control:\n\n  - “The exceptions and amendments to the International Fire Code contained in the provisions of chapter 19.27 RCW shall apply in case of conflict with any of the provisions of these rules.” [Source 9]\n\n  So Seattle and King County must at least meet the state‑amended IFC baseline.\n\nWhat this implies for “fire code verification” differences\n\nFrom the above:\n\n- **Baseline technical standards** (what must be built, what systems are required) are the same statewide, including Seattle and King County, because both must enforce the IFC as adopted in chapter 51‑54A WAC [Source 3], [Source 4], and any state‑level amendments in RCW 19.27 [Source 9].\n\n- **Verification processes** (how compliance is checked) can legitimately differ because:\n  - Each jurisdiction is responsible for enforcement [Source 5].\n  - Administrative provisions can be locally amended without SBCC review [Source 5].\n\nIn practice, that means Seattle and King County can differ in areas such as (examples of “verification” aspects that are typically administrative):\n\n- Which department is the “fire code official” and how authority is delegated.\n- Required submittals for fire‑protection system permits (drawings, calculations, third‑party engineer stamps).\n- Inspection sequencing (e.g., rough‑in vs. final, required witness tests).\n- Use of third‑party special inspectors or peer review.\n- Local fee schedules and timelines.\n- Internal policies on risk‑based inspection frequency for existing occupancies.\n\nHowever, the retrieved documents do **not** include Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), Seattle Fire Code amendments, or King County Code texts, so:\n\n- I cannot quote or compare specific Seattle vs. King County verification procedures.\n- I cannot identify any concrete point where Seattle’s verification rules diverge from King County’s, beyond the general allowance for different administrative approaches.\n\nIf you want a conflict/friction analysis\n\nIf your real interest is: “Where do Seattle’s and King County’s fire‑code verification rules conflict with state law or with each other?” then I would need to:\n\n1. Pull specific Seattle fire‑code/administrative provisions (e.g., SMC/Seattle Fire Code or Director’s Rules).\n2. Pull specific King County fire‑code/administrative provisions.\n3. Compare each to the state IFC adoption in chapter 51‑54A WAC and RCW 19.27, and then run the conflict‑classification process.\n\nBecause the current excerpts only show the **state** side, I cannot yet do that.\n\nNotes\n\n- The materials provided show:\n  - State adoption and effective date of the IFC [Source 3], [Source 4].\n  - Local enforcement duty and ability to contract out enforcement [Source 5].\n  - Local amendment procedures and the special treatment of administrative provisions [Source 5].\n  - Priority of state amendments over the base IFC [Source 9].\n\n- They do **not** show:\n  - Seattle‑specific fire‑code verification rules.\n  - King‑County‑specific fire‑code verification rules.\n\nIf you can specify a particular verification topic (e.g., “sprinkler acceptance testing,” “fire alarm commissioning,” “existing high‑rise inspection frequency”) and, ideally, provide or identify the Seattle and King County code sections you’re concerned about, I can then look for and analyze any state–local or city–county friction in a structured way.", "input_tokens": 2310, "output_tokens": 1295, "total_tokens": 3605, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 12850}

Based on the materials you provided, here are the core usage requirements:\n\n1. **Work-hours eligibility (general PFML)**  \n   - To be eligible for PFML benefits, an employee must have worked **at least 820 hours** in “employment” during the qualifying period (generally the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters, or the last four completed quarters) [Source 5].  \n   - Citation: “Employees are eligible for family and medical leave benefits… after working for at least eight hundred twenty hours in employment during the qualifying period.” RCW 50A.15.010 [Source 5].\n\n2. **Eligibility under an employer’s voluntary plan**  \n   - If an employer has an approved **voluntary plan** (instead of using the state plan), an employee qualifies for benefits under that voluntary plan after working **at least 340 hours for that employer** [Source 1].  \n   - The employer may **waive** this 340‑hour requirement (in whole or in part) to allow immediate eligibility [Source 1].  \n   - While transitioning, an employee who had coverage under the state plan **retains state coverage** until they qualify under the new employer’s voluntary plan [Source 1].  \n   - Citation: RCW 50A.30.020(1)–(3) [Source 1].\n\n3. **Qualifying reasons to use PFML (family & medical leave)**  \n   The PFML program covers both medical leave (for the employee’s own serious health condition) and family leave. From the provided text, one key family-leave use is:  \n   - **Bonding with a child**: To bond with the employee’s child during the **first 12 months after birth** or the **first 12 months after placement** of a child under 18 with the employee (e.g., adoption or foster placement) [Source 6].  \n   - Citation: RCW 50A.05.010(10)(b) [paraphrased in combined chapter] [Source 6].  \n\n   (Other qualifying reasons—such as caring for a family member with a serious health condition or certain military exigencies—are part of PFML but not fully quoted in the excerpts you provided.)\n\n4. **Waiting period requirement**  \n   - For most PFML claims, there is a **waiting period of the first 7 consecutive calendar days** before benefits are payable [Sources 2, 3, 9].  \n   - The waiting period begins on the **Sunday of the first week** the employee starts taking PFML [Source 9].  \n   - The employee must take **at least 8 consecutive hours of leave in that first week** to satisfy the waiting period [Source 9].  \n   - No benefits are paid for hours claimed during the waiting period [Source 9].  \n   - The waiting period **does not reduce** the maximum duration of leave [Source 9].  \n   - An employee generally only has to meet **one waiting period per claim year** [Source 9].  \n   - Citations:  \n     - RCW 50A.15.020(1)(a) (7‑day waiting period) [Sources 2, 3].  \n     - WAC 192‑500‑185(1)–(6) (definition and mechanics of waiting period) [Source 9].\n\n5. **When the waiting period does NOT apply**  \n   The waiting period is waived for certain types of leave:  \n   - **Medical leave taken upon the birth of a child** [Source 8].  \n   - **Family leave for bonding** after the child’s birth or placement [Source 8].  \n   - **Family leave for a qualified military exigency** [Source 8].  \n   - Employees may use employer-provided paid time off during the waiting period without affecting satisfaction of the waiting period [Sources 2, 8].  \n   - Citations:  \n     - RCW 50A.15.020(1)(a) (no waiting period for birth/placement or qualifying exigency) [Sources 2, 3].  \n     - WAC 192‑500‑185(7)–(8) [Source 8].\n\n6. **Minimum claim duration (how much leave you must take to claim a week)**  \n   - The **minimum claim duration** is **8 consecutive hours in a week** [Source 10].  \n   - If an employee takes at least 8 consecutive hours of leave at any point in a week, they can include other non‑consecutive hours missed that week in the same claim [Source 10].  \n   - Citation: WAC 192‑620‑005(1) [Source 10].\n\n7. **Maximum duration of PFML benefits**  \n   - **Paid family leave**: Maximum duration is **12 times the employee’s typical workweek hours** in a claim year [Source 7].  \n   - **Paid medical leave**: Also **12 times the typical workweek hours** per claim year, but may be extended to **14 times** the typical workweek hours if the employee has a serious health condition with pregnancy that results in a period of incapacity [Source 7].  \n   - Citation: WAC 192‑610‑055(1)–(2) [Source 7].\n\n8. **Parental leave under state civil service rules (for state employees)**  \n   Separate from PFML, state civil service rules require parental leave for certain state employees:  \n   - Must be granted for:  \n     - Birth and care of a newborn child, or  \n     - Placement of a minor/dependent child for adoption or foster care [Source 4].  \n   - Must be taken during the **first year** after birth or placement [Source 4].  \n   - Eligibility: Only **permanent employees** or those who have worked for the state at least **12 months** and **1,250 hours** in the previous 12 months qualify [Source 4].  \n   - Citations: WAC 357‑31‑460 and 357‑31‑465 [Source 4].  \n\nIf you tell me whether you’re an employee or employer (and if you’re dealing with a voluntary plan or the state plan), I can narrow this down to the specific usage rules that apply to your situation.", "input_tokens": 2746, "output_tokens": 1353, "total_tokens": 4099, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 18236}

USER NOTE: The ASCE tsunami design geodatabase is not adopted for design purposes in Washington state.” [Source 4]\n\n2. **How inundation depth and flow velocity are set for Risk Category II & III**\n\n   - Washington adds a specific rule for Tsunami Risk Category II and III buildings:\n     - “6.5.1 Tsunami Risk Category II and III buildings and other structures. **The Maximum Considered Tsunami inundation depth and tsunami flow velocity characteristics at a Tsunami Risk Category II or III building or other structure shall be determined by the WA‑TDZ maps. Those parameters shall be used as the Maximum Considered Tsunami inundation depth and tsunami flow velocity characteristics in lieu of the Energy Grade Line Analysis in Section 6.6.**” [Source 3]\n\n   In other words, for Risk Category II and III:\n   - The **“limits” of inundation** (horizontal extent) and the **design inundation depth and flow velocity** are taken directly from the WA‑TDZ products, not from ASCE’s default methods.\n\n3. **When there is no mapped inundation limit shown**\n\n   - Washington modifies ASCE 7 §6.5.1.1 for cases where the WA‑TDZ map does not show an inundation limit:\n     - “For Tsunami Risk Category II and III buildings and other structures **where no mapped inundation limit is shown in the Tsunami Design Zone map**, the ratio of tsunami runup elevation above Mean High Water Level to Offshore Tsunami Amplitude, R/HT, shall be permitted to be determined using the surf similarity parameter ξ100, according to Eqs. (6.5‑2a, b, c, d, or e) and Fig. 6.5‑1.” [Source 6]\n\n   So:\n   - If your site is **inside** a WA‑TDZ inundation area, the **limit** is the mapped inundation boundary and the associated depth/velocity values.\n   - If your site is **outside** or there is **no mapped limit**, you may use the ASCE 7 surf‑similarity method to determine runup (R/HT) per §6.5.1.1 as modified.\n\n4. **Scope of application (who must use these limits)**\n\n   - Washington’s tsunami provisions apply to certain risk categories in tsunami design zones:\n     - “1615.1 General. The design and construction of Risk Category III and IV buildings and structures located in the Tsunami Design Zones shall be in accordance with Chapter 6 of ASCE 7‑22, except as modified by this code.” [Source 5], [Source 2]\n\n   - Then Washington extends the use of WA‑TDZ parameters to **Tsunami Risk Category II and III** buildings via the added §6.5.1 language quoted above [Source 3].\n\n   Practically:\n   - If a building is classified as **Tsunami Risk Category II or III** and is in a mapped tsunami design zone, its **design tsunami depth and velocity limits** are those given by WA‑TDZ for that location.\n   - The **horizontal limit** of concern is the WA‑TDZ inundation boundary for the Maximum Considered Tsunami.\n\n5. **Where to find the actual numeric limits for a given site**\n\n   The code text itself does not list numbers; it points you to the WA‑TDZ products:\n   - WA‑TDZ maps and geodatabase at: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/wa‑tdz [Source 4], [Source 7], [Source 3]\n\n   From those, for a specific site you obtain:\n   - Whether the site is within a tsunami design zone (inundation limit),\n   - Maximum Considered Tsunami **inundation depth** at the site,\n   - **Flow velocity** at the site.\n\nIf you provide a location (city or coordinates) and the building’s risk category, I can outline how you would read the WA‑TDZ products for that site and how those values become the governing “limits” for your Tsunami Risk Category II or III design.", "input_tokens": 3505, "output_tokens": 1147, "total_tokens": 4652, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 12408}

[Source 4]\n\n3. **Group care facilities – WAC 110‑145‑1395**  \n   - “We may make exceptions and license or continue to license you if you do not meet the minimum licensing regulations. We may allow this if you can demonstrate that you can provide for the safety, health and well‑being of children in your care.”  \n     [Source 10]  \n   - Again, DCYF may limit/restrict the license and require a compliance agreement, and the provider must keep a copy of the approved exception. [Source 10]\n\nThese show the **core requirement** for any licensing exemption/exception DCYF grants:  \n- You must still be able to ensure **safety, health, and well‑being** of children; and  \n- DCYF has discretion to approve or deny; denial may not be appealable (as in WAC 110‑149‑0400(2) [Source 2]).\n\nFor child care centers (chapter 110‑300 WAC), DCYF uses the same concept: they can approve **exceptions** to specific rules, but only if children’s safety and well‑being are protected. The exact section for 110‑300 isn’t in the excerpts, but the pattern is consistent across DCYF licensing chapters.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Being “exempt from needing a license” vs. “getting an exception to a rule”\n\nThere are two different ideas:\n\n1. **Statutory/license exemption (no license required at all)**  \n   - Defined in **RCW 43.216.010(2)** and implemented in **WAC 110‑300‑0025** (not in the provided text).  \n   - Examples (from general knowledge, not from the retrieved text, so treat these as *illustrative only*):  \n     - Occasional babysitting, care by relatives, certain school‑operated programs, etc.  \n   - If you fall into one of these categories, you do **not** need a DCYF license.\n\n2. **Regulatory exception (you are licensed, but DCYF waives/modifies a specific rule)**  \n   - This is what WAC 110‑149‑0400, 110‑148‑1630, and 110‑145‑1395 show [Sources 2, 4, 10].  \n   - Requirements for this type of exemption/exception:\n     - DCYF must find you can still provide for children’s **safety, health, and well‑being**. [Sources 2, 4, 10]  \n     - DCYF may limit or restrict your license and require a compliance agreement. [Sources 4, 10]  \n     - You must keep a copy of the approved exception in your files. [Sources 4, 10]  \n     - In some programs (e.g., kinship homes), you **do not have appeal rights** if DCYF denies the exemption. [Source 2]\n\nFor child care centers, when people ask “exemption requirements,” they usually mean the **statutory categories that don’t need a license at all**. Those are in RCW 43.216.010(2) and WAC 110‑300‑0025, which are not in the snippets I have, so I cannot quote them directly.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What you should check next\n\nTo know if **your specific situation** is exempt from needing a license, you must look at:\n\n- **RCW 43.216.010(2)** – statutory definition of who is exempt from licensing; and  \n- **WAC 110‑300‑0025** – “License exemptions” for early learning programs (implements the statute).\n\nBecause those sections are not in the retrieved context, I cannot list the exemption categories verbatim. You’ll need to read those two sections directly, or I can help interpret them if you paste them here.\n\n---\n\n### 4. If you are already licensed (or applying) and want an exception to a rule\n\nFrom the WAC examples above, the **requirements** for DCYF to grant an exception to a licensing rule are:\n\n1. You request an exception from DCYF (usually in writing, through your licensor).  \n2. DCYF must determine that, even without strict compliance with that rule, you can still provide for the **safety, health, and well‑being** of children in your care. [Sources 2, 4, 10]  \n3. DCYF may:\n   - Limit or restrict your license; and/or  \n   - Require a **compliance agreement** to ensure safety and well‑being. [Sources 4, 10]  \n4. You must keep a copy of the approved exception in your files. [Sources 4, 10]  \n5. In some programs, you **cannot appeal** if DCYF denies the exemption. [Source 2]\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me how you plan to provide care (in your home vs. a center, number/ages of children, and whether you’re related to them), I can help you check whether you likely fall into a statutory **license‑exempt** category (using general knowledge) and then point you to the exact RCW/WAC sections you should read to confirm.", "input_tokens": 5871, "output_tokens": 1538, "total_tokens": 7409, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 16169}

The Washington adoption document lists the key occupancy chapters and sections [Source 9]:\n   - **Assembly Group A** – WAC 51‑50‑0303  \n   - **Educational Group E** – WAC 51‑50‑0305  \n   - **Factory Group F** – WAC 51‑50‑0306  \n   - **Institutional Group I** – WAC 51‑50‑0308  \n   - **Mercantile Group M** – WAC 51‑50‑0309  \n   - **Residential Group R** – WAC 51‑50‑0310  \n\n   These “Group A, E, F, I, M, R, etc.” are what most people mean by “building use code” in Washington: they determine which code requirements apply (exits, fire protection, structural loads, accessibility, etc.) based on how the building is used.\n\n3. **Residential vs. commercial energy use**  \n   The **Washington State Energy Code – Residential** (WAC 51‑11R) defines its scope and makes clear it is the **maximum and minimum energy code** for residential construction in every city and county [Source 8]:\n   - **R101.2 Scope** – applies to **residential buildings** and their sites and systems, and is “the maximum and minimum energy code for residential construction in each town, city and county” [Source 8].  \n   - Certain residential‑type occupancies (e.g., Group I‑1 Condition 2 assisted living and residential treatment facilities) must instead use the **commercial** energy code sections [Source 8], [Source 5].\n\n   The **commercial** energy code (WAC 51‑11C) similarly applies to **commercial buildings and building sites** [Source 4].\n\n4. **Special cases – wildland‑urban interface and early learning**  \n   - **Wildland‑Urban Interface Code** (WAC 51‑55) applies to buildings in designated wildland‑urban interface areas and governs construction, alteration, repair, etc., in those areas [Source 2].  \n   - **Early learning facilities**: WAC 110‑300‑0415 requires early learning program spaces to comply with the **Washington State Building Code or local building code** in effect at the time of licensure [Source 6]. This ties child‑care/early learning “use” back to the same occupancy‑based building code framework.\n\n5. **Where to look for your specific “use”**  \n   To find the exact rules for a particular building use (for example, apartments, offices, warehouses, schools, day‑care, etc.), you would typically:\n   1. Identify the **occupancy group** in the IBC/IRC as adopted in WAC 51‑50 and 51‑51 (e.g., Group R‑2 for apartments, Group B for offices, Group A‑3 for many assembly uses, etc.).  \n   2. Then apply:\n      - The relevant IBC/IRC chapters (fire protection, egress, structural, accessibility, etc.) as amended by WAC 51‑50 / 51‑51.  \n      - The appropriate **energy code** (WAC 51‑11R or 51‑11C) based on whether it is a residential or commercial building [Source 4], [Source 8].\n\nIf you tell me the specific type of building or use you’re interested in (e.g., “small daycare in a house,” “apartment building,” “warehouse with office,” etc.), I can point you to the likely occupancy group and the exact WAC/IBC sections that apply.", "input_tokens": 3335, "output_tokens": 1094, "total_tokens": 4429, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 22935}

I do not have Seattle‑specific fire/egress amendments (SMC/Seattle Fire Code) in the provided materials, so I can only compare **state‑level IFC/IBC amendments to NFPA 130** (also adopted by the state). That means I can show friction between *different state‑level frameworks* (IFC/IBC vs NFPA 130 as modified), but I cannot show **State vs City** conflicts for egress because no SMC/Seattle Fire Code text was retrieved.\n\n---\n\n### Friction Matrix – Fire Egress (within State‑level frameworks)\n\n| # | Topic | State Citation & Quote | Other Framework Citation & Quote | Friction Type* | Justification |\n|---|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 1 | Travel distance in fixed transit / passenger rail stations | **IFC/IBC (WA amendments) – General travel distance rules**: Chapter 10 sets general travel distance and common path limits by occupancy, with special notes (e.g., “The common path of egress travel distance shall only apply in a Group R‑3 occupancy located in a mixed occupancy building” [Source 10]; “For the travel distance limitations in Group I‑2, see Section 407.4” [Source 10]). | **NFPA 130 as modified by WA IFC – Station‑specific travel distance**: “5.3.3.4 Travel distance. For open stations the maximum travel distance on the platform to a point at which a means of egress route leaves the platform shall not exceed 100 m (325 ft.). For enclosed stations the travel distance to an exit shall not exceed 76 m (250 ft.).” [Source 2], [Source 3] | Type II – Different but harmonized special rule | The general IFC/IBC Chapter 10 travel‑distance framework is superseded for fixed transit/passenger rail stations by a specific NFPA 130‑based rule written into the WA IFC. The texts differ in numeric limits and structure, but the IFC explicitly directs stations to follow Section 4901 (NFPA 130 modifications) [Source 6], so this is a **specialized override**, not a direct contradiction. |\n| 2 | Means of egress framework for stations | **IFC/IBC (WA amendments) – General means of egress**: Chapter 10 provides the base rules for means of egress for all occupancies (exit number, sizing, travel distance, etc.) [Sources 5, 7, 9, 10]. | **NFPA 130 as modified – explicit cross‑reference**: “5.3.1.1 The provisions for means of egress for a station shall comply with the International Building Code, Chapter 10, except as herein modified.” [Source 6] | Type II – Specialized overlay | NFPA 130 adopts IBC Chapter 10 as the base but then modifies it for stations. This creates a **dual framework**: designers must apply IBC Ch. 10 generally, then apply NFPA 130’s specific modifications (e.g., travel distance, escalator capacity, door capacities). It is not a conflict in the sense of incompatible commands; it is a layered system that can create complexity and potential for mis‑application. |\n| 3 | Number of exits in large spaces vs. fixed transit stations | **IFC/IBC (WA amendments) – Exit count by occupant load**: “1006.2.1.1 Three or more exits or exit access doorways. Three exits or exit access doorways shall be provided from any space with an occupant load of 501 to 1,000. Four exits or exit access doorways shall be provided from any space with an occupant load greater than 1,000.” [Source 5] | **IFC/WA amendment – special reduction for open transit stations**: Same section adds: “EXCEPTION: The number of required exits for fixed transit and passenger rail systems may be reduced by one at open stations.” [Source 5] | Type II – Explicit exception | The general rule requires 3 or 4 exits based on occupant load; the same state‑level amendment then **allows one fewer exit** for open fixed‑transit stations. This is a deliberate, text‑stated exception rather than an unintentional conflict, but it does create a **different safety margin** for those facilities compared to other occupancies with similar loads. |\n| 4 | Use of escalators as means of egress | **IFC/IBC (WA amendments) – General treatment of escalators**: The WA‑modified NFPA 130 section states: “5.3.11.1 Illumination of the means of egress in stations, including escalators that are considered a means of egress, shall be in accordance with the International Building Code Section 1008. 5.3.11.2 Means of egress, including escalators considered as means of egress, shall be provided with a system of emergency lighting in accordance with the International Building Code Section 1008.” [Source 1] | **NFPA 130 as modified – capacity limit on escalators**: “5.3.5.4 Escalators shall not account for more than one‑half of the egress capacity at any one level.” [Source 3] | Type II – Additional constraint | General IBC/IFC practice is cautious about counting escalators as egress; NFPA 130 (as modified) explicitly allows escalators to be considered part of the means of egress but then caps their contribution to **no more than 50% of egress capacity**. This is a **stricter, specialized rule** layered on top of the general egress framework for stations. |\n| 5 | Door/gate egress capacity vs. general IBC door sizing | **IBC/IFC (WA) – General door width/egress capacity**: Chapter 10 normally bases door capacity on clear width and a capacity factor (people per inch of width), but the specific numeric factor is not shown in the retrieved snippets. | **NFPA 130 as modified – explicit door/gate capacity for public areas**: “5.3.7.1 The egress capacity for doors and gates in a means of egress serving public areas shall be computed as follows: 1. Sixty people per minute (p/min) for single leaf doors and gates. 2. 0.0819 p/mm‑min (2.08 p/in.‑min) for biparting multileaf doors and gates measured for the clear width dimension.” [Source 3] | Type II – Different metric / method | For stations, NFPA 130 uses a **time‑based flow rate** (people per minute and per inch of width) for doors and gates, which is not the same as the standard IBC static capacity factor. The IFC/WA amendment explicitly inserts this NFPA 130 method for public‑area egress in stations, so designers must use a **different calculation method** there. This is a specialized override, not a direct contradiction, but it can lead to different required widths than a pure IBC calculation. |\n\n\\*Friction Type definitions (as used here):  \n- **Type I – Direct conflict**: One rule requires X, another prohibits X.  \n- **Type II – Different / specialized rule**: One framework adds or changes requirements for a subset of situations (overlay/exception).  \n- **Type III – Ambiguity / gap**: Overlapping rules leave unclear which applies or how to reconcile.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n1. **No State vs City (SMC/Seattle Fire Code) conflicts shown**:  \n   The retrieved context only includes Washington‑amended IFC/IBC and NFPA 130 modifications. I do not have Seattle Municipal Code fire/egress provisions or Seattle Fire Code amendments in the provided documents, so I cannot identify or substantiate **State vs City** conflicts. Any such comparison would require SMC/Seattle Fire Code text.\n\n2. **Discarded / unconfirmed topics** (due to missing one side of the comparison):  \n   - Differences between **State IFC/IBC** and **Seattle Fire Code** on:  \n     - Maximum common path of travel distances  \n     - Stair width and capacity factors  \n     - Use of security grilles on exits  \n     - Emergency lighting and signage specifics  \n   For each of these, I only have state‑level IFC/IBC text, not the corresponding Seattle amendments, so no conflict determination is possible from the materials.\n\n3. **Within‑state layering rather than outright contradictions**:  \n   The evidence shows Washington has chosen to handle complex occupancies (especially **fixed transit and passenger rail stations**) by layering NFPA 130‑based provisions on top of the IFC/IBC. This produces **Type II friction**—specialized rules that override or refine the general egress framework—rather than direct Type I conflicts.\n\nIf you want, I can next focus on a specific facility type (e.g., high‑rise residential, hospitals, transit stations) and, once we have the relevant city‑level code text, build a more detailed State vs City friction matrix for that occupancy.", "input_tokens": 5779, "output_tokens": 1963, "total_tokens": 7742, "sources_count": 10, "temperature": 0.1, "duration_ms": 20158}
